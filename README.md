# Group_E_Snakes_and_Ladders
Game Project based on C programming language


Purpose: Due to COVID 19 pandemic and its effects, people are isolated, stressed and worried. To provide a feeling of competency, autonomy and to relieve stress, we propose a game as the best time killing application. We chose snakes and ladders for our project as it is a classic and easy game to play. We will be simulating the game using C Programming language. The main idea is to reciprocate a board game into an online game application for easy access.
